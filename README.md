# MNIST-images
Recognition of MNIST images

This project recognises the MNIST images using neural networks in R. 
Used a large data set of size 28x28 and shrunk the image size to 7x7. 
Averaged and scaled each 4x4 square of pixels.
Used the training data to build the neural network, and the testing data to test it with minimum cost function.
